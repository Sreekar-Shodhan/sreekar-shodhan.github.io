I'm Vivek Shukla, a full-stack Software Engineer with a passion for problem solving and a love for learning 

My Background
======

I'm a 22-year-old Software Engineer working on some cool projects and a Computer Science student at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore. My interests are diverse and include computer programming, machine learning, artificial intelligence, blockchain, electric vehicles, green energy, physics, economics, finance, business, philosophy, and more. I'm always seeking out new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.

As a full-stack software engineer, I bring a wide range of experience to my work, always striving to create refined, functional, and scalable products. I'm passionate about all aspects of technology and applied problem solving, and I love nothing more than bringing innovative solutions to complex challenges.

When I'm not at my computer, you can find me playing guitar, sketching, working out at the gym, or traveling the world.
